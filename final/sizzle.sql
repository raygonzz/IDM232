This two-sided essential is designed to do two jobs in one: crush garlic and slice it. Made by Harold Import Company, a family-owned American business with over 50 years of experience, this easy-to-use press owes its incredible durability to its heavyweight, stainless steel construction. To use it, simply place the clove in the hopper and press downward for freshly pressed garlic, or flip it over to get uniform slices of garlic. And to ensure minimal mess, it includes a handy cleaning tool for removing leftover pressed garlic after use.', 'Step 1: Cook the rice Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. In a medium pot, combine the rice, a big pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups of water. Heat to boiling on high. Once boiling, cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook 12 to 14 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. Turn off the heat and fluff with a fork. Cover to keep warm.\n*\nStep 2: Prepare the ingredients & make the glaze While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Peel and roughly chop the garlic. Remove and discard the stems of the kale; finely chop the leaves. Using a peeler, remove the lime rind, avoiding the white pith; mince to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Halve the lime crosswise. Halve the orange; squeeze the juice into a bowl, straining out any seeds. Whisk in the chile paste and 2 tablespoons of water until smooth.\n*\nStep 3: Roast the carrots Place the sliced carrots on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\n*\nStep 4: Cook the garlic & kale While the carrots roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic and cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the chopped kale; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until slightly wilted. Add 1/3 cup of water; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes, or until the kale has wilted and the water has cooked off. Transfer to the pot of cooked rice. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.\n*\nStep 5: Cook & glaze the chicken While the carrots continue to roast, pat the chicken dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In the same pan, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned chicken and cook 4 to 6 minutes on the first side, or until browned. Flip and cook 2 to 3 minutes, or until lightly browned. Add the glaze and cook, frequently spooning the glaze over the chicken, 2 to 3 minutes, or until the chicken is coated and cooked through. Turn off the heat; stir the butter and the juice of 1 lime half into the glaze until the butter has melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n*\nStep 6: Finish the rice & serve your dish To the pot of cooked rice and kale, add the lime zest, crème fraîche, raisins, and the juice of the remaining lime half.

Wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut the sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1-inch-wide wedges. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer, skin side down. Roast 27 to 29 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Reserving the sheet pan, transfer to a plate and set aside in a warm place.\n*\nStep 2: Prepare the remaining ingredients & make the sauce While the sweet potatoes roast, cut off and discard the root end of the lettuce; thinly slice the leaves. Halve the rolls. In a bowl, combine the mayonnaise, creamy mustard sauce, and sweet pickle relish. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels. Halve crosswise.\n*\nStep 3: Bread the fish While the sweet potatoes continue to roast, season the halved fish fillets on both sides with salt, pepper, and the spice blend. Crack the eggs into a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Beat until smooth. Place the breadcrumbs on a plate; season with salt and pepper. Working one piece at a time, thoroughly coat the seasoned fillets in the beaten eggs (letting any excess drip off), then in the breadcrumbs (pressing to adhere). Transfer to a separate plate.\n*\nStep 4: Cook the fish While the sweet potatoes continue to roast, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a thin layer of oil on medium-high until hot. Once the oil is hot enough that a pinch of breadcrumbs sizzles immediately when added, working in batches if necessary, add the breaded fish fillets. Cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. (If the pan seems dry, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil before flipping.) Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; immediately season with salt and pepper.\n*\nStep 5: Toast the rolls While the fish cooks, place the rolls on the same sheet pan, cut side up. Drizzle with olive oil. Toast in the oven 4 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned. Transfer to a clean work surface.\n*\nStep 6: Assemble the sandwiches & serve your dish Divide the sauce, cooked fish fillets, and sliced lettuce among the toasted rolls. Serve the sandwiches with the roasted sweet potatoes on the side.

(65, 'Tilapia & Black Lentil Salad', 'with Lemon Pan Sauce', 'In this dish, weʼre putting a twist on Italian gremolata: adding pickled peppers to the\nclassic parsley, garlic, and lemon condiment. The bright, tangy flavors perk up a hearty\nsalad of black lentils and roasted broccoli. Weʼre also using lemon juice as the base for\nan easy pan sauce to serve over our seared tilapia.', '½ cup Black Beluga Lentils \n2 cloves Garlic \n1 Lemon \n½ lb Broccoli \n1 bunch Parsley \n2 Tbsps Butter \n1 oz Golden Or Red Sweet Piquante Peppers \n1 Tbsp Capers', 'stainless steel strainer', 'A stainless steel strainer is a handy tool for quinoa. It\'s great for draining grains and pastas (not to mention small fruits and vegetables after washing) and straining stocks and gravy. Lightweight and sturdy, itʼs constructed with a double-fine mesh.', '\nStep 1: Cook the lentils. Place an oven rack in the center of the oven, then preheat to 450°F. Heat a medium saucepan of salted water to boiling on high. Once boiling, add the lentils and cook, uncovered, 24 to 26 minutes, or until tender. Turn off the heat. Drain thoroughly and rinse under warm water; return to the pot. Cover to keep warm.\n*\nStep 2: Prepare & roast the broccoli. While the lentils cook, wash and dry the fresh produce. Cut off and discard the bottom 1/2 inch of the broccoli stem; cut the broccoli into small pieces, keeping the florets intact. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 15 to 17 minutes, or until browned and tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from the oven.\n*\nStep 3: Prepare the remaining ingredients. While the broccoli roasts, peel the garlic. Roughly chop 1 clove. Finely chop the remaining clove; using the flat side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Using a peeler, remove the yellow rind of the lemon, avoiding the white pith; mince the rind to get 2 teaspoons of zest (or use a zester). Quarter and deseed the lemon. Roughly chop the peppers. Finely chop the parsley leaves and stems. To make the gremolata, in a bowl, combine the lemon zest, chopped peppers, half the chopped parsley, the juice of 2 lemon wedges, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and as much of the garlic paste as you’d like. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n*\nStep 4: Cook the fish. Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels; season with salt and pepper on both sides. In a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the seasoned fillets and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, or until lightly browned and cooked through. Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a plate.\n*\nStep 5: Make the pan sauce. Add the capers, chopped garlic, butter, and 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; season with salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high, stirring constantly and scraping up any fond, 1 to 2 minutes, or until browned and fragrant. Turn off the heat; stir in the juice of the remaining lemon wedges (be careful, as the liquid may splatter). Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n*\nStep 6: Finish the lentils & serve your dish To the saucepan of cooked lentils, add the roasted broccoli and gremolata. Stir to combine; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve the finished lentils with the cooked fish fillets. Top the fish with the pan sauce. Garnish with the remaining chopped parsley.
